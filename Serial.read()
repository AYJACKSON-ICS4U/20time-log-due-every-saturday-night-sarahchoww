Learning what Serial.read() is:

The computer reads the input from the user through the serial monitor. I searched up how it worked and got the following code:


char degree = 0;

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  if (Serial.available() > 0) {
    degree = Serial.read();
    Serial.print("You inputted ");
    Serial.println(degree);
  }
}


This code takes in the input from the user and then says "You inputted: [value inputted]"

I had some trouble with this code because the value outputted would always be 48 values greater than what I inputted. I then discovered
that it was because in ACSII, 48 = 0. I then switched "int degree= 0;" to "char degree = 0" so the value outputted would be
exactly what was inputted.

I am now learning how to input more than one digit at a time through the Serial.read() since it would separate the values.
Ex: *input 10*  outputs: "You inputted 1", "You inputted 0"
