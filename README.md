# 20Time-ICS4U

**September 17 - 23, 2017:**
  Chose my 20 time project
  Project: create a robot to complete easy tasks (ie: maze).
  joined the robotics club at AYJ, hopefully helps me complete the project.
  Two mentors from the robotics club to help my 20 time project
  
  
  
**September 25 - 29, 2017:**
  Getting in contact with the head of the club and see when it starts



**October 2-5, 2017:**
  Thought about the project, aim to do more research.
  Talking to the head of club and have yet to receive a response




**October 9 - 13, 2017:**
  Started robotics club, learning how to use a breadboard and arduinos



**October 16 - 20, 2017:**
  Continued with robotics club and controlled the voltage going through to the lightbulb on the breadboard.
  Learning about sensors next week




**October 23 - 27, 2017:**
  Learned how to use sensors in Robotics club. Looking to start building a robot soon.



**October 30 - November 3:**
  Robotics club was cancelled this week.
  Have yet to purchase my own arduino
  
 **November 6 - November 10:**
  Got my own Arduino Nano board so I advance in my progress for my 20Time project instead of just attending the weekly Robotics Club meetings. Tried to download the Arduino program at home on the IMac but the arduino nano couldn't be recognized. This is a common error amongst other users and the solution is tedious and involves changing code in the computer. Tried to download Arduino program on other Windows computers at home but it either didn't work because the computer was too old or it downloaded and the arduino couldn't be recognized within the system. Just attempted to plug it into the school computer and, again, the port wasn't recognized in the computer. Will look to finding another cord since that may be the source of error and if that doesn't work then I'll ask Geoff, the head of the Robotics Club, tomorrow at the meeting.
  
  *update:* The Arduino program now recognizes the port and the arduino works! I was just updating my log and then I checked again (10 minutes after I plugged the arduino in) and it works now. Need to try this at home.
  
  *November 14:* Have yet to try the arduino at home again but Robotics Club has a meeting today so I will ask Geoff how I'd be able to download the program on an IMac.

  **November 13 - 17:**
    Still trying to figure out how to download the program at home.
    
  **November 20 - 24:**
    Will ask my sister who has downloaded the program on her mac how she did it

  **November 27 - Dec 1:**
    Learned how a servo works from Robotics Club. Got an arduino uno, works fine on my computer with no error. Attached the servo that I borrowed from Robotics Club and used the "Sweep" example from the sketchbook. I altered the delay so it would run smoothly.
