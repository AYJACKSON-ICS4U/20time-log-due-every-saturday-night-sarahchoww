Knob is another of the arduino's examples found in sketchbook. It's coded to be set up with a potentiometer but I don't own
one at home so I'm trying to mix the Serial.read with the Knob idea. I want the user to input a value into the serial monitor
using the Serial.read() and that value controls the degree of the servo.

Current code:

#include <Servo.h>

Servo myservo;  // create servo object to control a servo

int val;    // variable to read the value from the analog pin
char degree;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin (9600);
  myservo.attach(9);  // attaches the servo on pin 9 to the servo object
}

void loop() {
    // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  if (Serial.available() > 0) {
    degree = Serial.read();
    Serial.print("You inputted ");
    Serial.println(degree);
  }
  
  myservo.write(degree);                  // sets the servo position according to the scaled value
  delay(3);                           // waits for the servo to get there
}

This code works but similar to the Serial.read() problem, the computer only intakes 1 digit. My next task is to learn how it
can read more than 1 digit
