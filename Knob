Knob is another of the arduino's examples found in sketchbook. It's coded to be set up with a potentiometer but I don't own
one at home so I'm trying to mix the Serial.read with the Knob idea. I want the user to input a value into the serial monitor
using the Serial.read() and that value controls the degree of the servo.

Current code:

#include <Servo.h>

Servo myservo;  // create servo object to control a servo

int val;    // variable to read the value from the analog pin
char degree;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin (9600);
  myservo.attach(9);  // attaches the servo on pin 9 to the servo object
}

void loop() {
    // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  if (Serial.available() > 0) {
    degree = Serial.read();
    Serial.print("You inputted ");
    Serial.println(degree);
  }
  
  myservo.write(degree);                  // sets the servo position according to the scaled value
  delay(3);                           // waits for the servo to get there
}

This code works but similar to the Serial.read() problem, the computer only intakes 1 digit. My next task is to learn how it
can read more than 1 digit.



Got the serial monitor to read more than one digit by using Serial.parseInt. It reads all of the integer entries and ignores
those that aren't an integer entry.

#include <Servo.h>

Servo myservo;  // create servo object to control a servo

//int potpin = 0;  // analog pin used to connect the potentiometer
int val;    // variable to read the value from the analog pin
int degree; //changed char to int to match the Serial.parseInt

void setup() {
  Serial.begin (9600);
  myservo.attach(9);  // attaches the servo on pin 9 to the servo object
}

void loop() {
  //val = analogRead(potpin);            // reads the value of the potentiometer (value between 0 and 1023)
  //val = map(val, 0, 1023, 0, 180);     // scale it to use it with the servo (value between 0 and 180)

    // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  if (Serial.available() > 0) { //make sure that an entry has been made by the user
    degree = Serial.parseInt(); //allows more than one digit to be entered
    Serial.print("You inputted ");
    Serial.println(degree);
  }

  myservo.write(degree); //transfers data to servo
  delay(3);
 
}




Trying to get a series of degrees entered and then have the servo run the degrees consecutively. Have yet to achieve so,
the servo only runs one of the entries.

  Serial.println(degree[i]);
  Serial.println("This is i"); //check var i
  Serial.println(i);
  
    // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
    if (i == 3) { //runs if 3 entries have been made, the servo will run in sequence of the entered degrees
      
      for (p = 1; p <= 3; p++)
      {
        myservo.write(degree[p]); //transfers data to servo based on array number p
        Serial.println(degree[p]);
         
         delay(15); //delay of 3 milliseconds
      }
    }
  
    i += 1; //switch place in array, increase by 1
  }
